# Personal-Library

This is an Odin Project assignment designed to help understand and utlilize object constructors as well as understand object prototypes and prototype inheritance.
The application that is being built is a personal library, in which a user can add and remove books they have or have not read. 

This project will be using vanilla JS, basic CSS and html. 

For the future:
I'd like to refactor the JS file - I have an understanding of object constructors and how their prototypes are used, but upon revisiting this code after a
break I feel as though I could have utilized that javaScript feature more efficiently.
